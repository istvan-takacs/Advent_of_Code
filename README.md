***Advent of Code 2025***

 This is a documentation of my journey and development through the problem set being released by the wonderful people behind Advent of code (full credits to them down below). This is only intended to be a journal of my progress through the 12 fun problems, adnd the takeaway lessons learned through it.

**Notes:**

*Day 1:* 
Quite a challenging problem especially with the second part. So many cases to consider with the turning of the dial accounting for all the edge cases. Once my approach was consolidated, the actual solution manifested itself in a fairly straightforward way.

*Day 2:*
I have been putting off learning RegEx for ages, so I was super excited once this problem gave me an excuse to dip my toes into that world as well. After having worked my way through a few tutorials on it, the problem itself turned out to be quite straightforward.  
I understand that string manipulation may have been a lot faster and more optimised perfoarmance-wise, however I wanted to challenge myself. This also allowed for a super easy Part 2.
